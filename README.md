# Overview

A menu for you.

Menyou is an app that lets you build a profile reflecting your unique taste in food. Then, it will recommend dishes from nearby restaurants with foods that fit your tastes.

# Usage

To run locally, please do the following:

1. (in separate terminal) `sudo mongod`
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp` (if you don't have `gulp`, run `sudo npm install -g gulp`)
4. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This will bring you the **main page**. Register for an account. Then, build your taste profile (i.e. the ingredients you like, the ingredients you dislike, and any allergies). When you're done, click the button to get recommended dishes. This may take some time, as the menu API (Locu) that we use is quite slow (they give you better speed if you pay for API access - we are using the free plan).

# Tests

We do **server** side testing with [mocha](http://mochajs.org/). To run the server tests, do this:

1. Install mocha (`sudo npm install -g mocha`)
2. Navigate to `server/app`
3. Run `mocha`

We do **client** side testing with [qunit](http://qunitjs.com/). To run the client tets, do this:

1. Open `client/source/assets/js/tests.js`
2. Set `Menyou.shouldTest = true` in the first line. 
3. Launch the app (see the **Usage** section of this README)
4. Now instead of displaying the app, the client side tests are run and the results are displayed.
